This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in HTML related to dynamically adding content using innerHTML.  The bug.html file shows the incorrect usage, which can lead to unexpected behavior and even security vulnerabilities (XSS). The bugSolution.html provides the correct approach, explaining the importance of using methods like textContent or DOM manipulation for safer and more predictable results. This is a crucial aspect for front-end developers to understand when creating dynamic web pages.
